## Class Materials

- Much of the material that we will be using in class is the RxJS and other related online documentation
  - The on-line documentation is excellent, thorough and extensive
  - This material is not intended to replicate the online documentation
- The class notes organize the material, fill in the gaps and provide additional annotations 


- The instructor's job is to explain, not just read the materials


- All class materials are in this [repository](https://github.com/ExgnoRepos/2413-Reactjs-May-21)
- Additional material may be added during the class
- The repository will be available for download for 30 days: it will be archived on June 22 2024

## Lab Machines

- You will be provided with your own VM with a RxJS development environment installed.
- There is a link to your personal VM in the LearnQuest Portal
- The instructor will walk through a demo of how to access and use the VMs
- If you want to use your own machines, there is a link to a repo with an npm project that you can use to install the necessary tools [Lab Setup](https://github.com/ExgnoRepos/2413-RxJS-Lab)
  - However, there will not be time during class to troubleshoot anyone's local setup.
